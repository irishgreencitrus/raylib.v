# raylib.v for raylib v4.2.0
![raylib.v icon](icon.png)

Have a problem? raylib.v currently requires the `master` branch of V, so please run `v up` before filing any issues.

Not a fork! This isn't a fork of vraylib but a wrapper built from the ground up with cross compatibility in mind.
raylib.v is a binding for raylib in V with an aim for 100% parity with the C library.
This probably suffices most uses for raylib at the moment, however some more advanced functionality is currently missing.

If you need said functionality, open an issue to prioritize it and bring it to my attention!

## Installation
Do `v install irishgreencitrus.raylibv`

Now you should be able to run the examples! (If you cannot, create an issue)
## Examples
See the `examples/` folder for some examples.
